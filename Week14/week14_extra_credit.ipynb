The answers were cogent and logical, which proved helpful and helped me comprehend the best approach when utilizing datasets, when visualizing insights and constructing questions to enhance my examination. It also suggested practical recommendations on how to maintain data quality and how to avoid problems with method redundancy or gaps.\n",

        "Nevertheless, a few issues were encountered: ChatGPT lacked the ability to lookup raw datasets or validate other online sources since it only acted as a knowledge-assisted mechanical turk. While it helped me lay a good ground work on working with data and visualizations, I had to make sure that the datasets I was sourcing for were relevant to my project. Moreover, it sometimes got confused about my intention behind my questions and I had to repeat myself.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, both in coding and in project structuring, I found ChatGPT to be helpful but it left the tasks of data set acquisition and validation to me. It could be made better by for instance extending the amounts of specific online sources or assisting to check links. Still, I found its ability to elaborate ideas and quickly create code helpful enough to become my primary assistant in the project."
